# 🏓 Ping Pong Game – Python Project

## 🎮 About This Project
This is an interactive **two-player Ping Pong game** built in Python using the `turtle` library.  
The game includes a **scoring system**, **dynamic speed control**, and real-time paddle movement for both players.  
When a player misses the ball, their opponent scores a point, and the ball speed resets to make the next round fair.

## ⚙️ Features
- 🧮 **Two-player mode** – Each player controls a paddle and competes to score points  
- ⚡ **Dynamic speed system** – Ball speed increases with each successful rally and resets after a missed shot  
- 🔁 **Automatic ball reflection** – The ball bounces off paddles and walls smoothly  
- 🏁 **Scoring system** – Each side has an independent score counter displayed on screen  
- 🎨 **Turtle graphics** – Simple yet effective visual interface without external libraries

## 💡 What I Learned
- Implementing **real-time game logic** using loops and conditions  
- Handling **collision detection** between the ball, paddles, and screen borders  
- Using **functions and OOP principles** to structure the code  
- Designing a **fair difficulty system** that increases challenge gradually  
- Managing **score updates and speed resets** dynamically
