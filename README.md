🏓 Ping Pong Game – Python Turtle

🎮 About the Project

This is a two-player Ping Pong game built with the Python Turtle library.
Each player controls a paddle, and the goal is to prevent the ball from passing their side of the screen.
Every time a player misses the ball, the opponent earns a point.

The ball speed increases gradually during the rally to make the game more challenging.
When a player loses a point, the ball speed resets to the initial level, keeping the game fair and balanced.

	•	Move Up → W
	•	Move Down → S
